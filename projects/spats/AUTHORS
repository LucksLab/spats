Cole Trapnell wrote the original code in the Spats package, with updates by Julius B. Lucks, Kyle E. Watters and Angela M Yu.
The Spats package implements a read mapping and reactivity analysis pipeline for calculating
SHAPE-Seq reactivities from an input set of next-generation reads. The reactivity calculation
implemented is described in:
