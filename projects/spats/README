About Spats
===========

Spats is a package originally developed to support: 

- Julius B. Lucks, Stefanie A. Mortimer, Cole Trapnell, Shujun Luo, 
	Sharon Aviron, Gary P. Schroth, Lior Pachter, Jennifer A. Doudna, and Adam P. Arkin, 
	SHAPE-Seq: Multiplexed RNA Secondary and Tertiary Structure Determination 
        PNAS, 2011, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1106501108
- Sharon Aviran, Cole Trapnell, Julius B. Lucks, Stefanie A. Mortimer, Shujun Luo,
	Gary P. Schroth, Jennifer A. Doudna, Adam P. Arkin, and Lior Pachter, 
	Modeling and automation of SHAPE-Seq analysis 
        PNAS, 2011, doi: 10.1073/pnas.1106541108

and now supports:

- David Loughrey, Kyle E. Watters, Alexander H. Settle, and Julius B. Lucks
  SHAPE-Seq 2.0: Systematic Optimization and Extension of High-Throughput
  Chemical Probing of RNA Structure with Next Generation Sequencing
      Nucleic Acids Research, 2014

The Spats package implements a read mapping and reactivity analysis pipeline for calculating
SHAPE-Seq reactivities from an input set of next-generation reads. The reactivity calculation
implemented is described in:

Spats Installation
==================

Spats requires several dependencies before being installed. For up-to-date
installation instructions for these dependencies and spats itself, please
visit http://spats.sourceforge.net .

Spats depends on Bowtie 0.12.8 or higher, which you can get from here:
http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml

Spats also uses a modified version the FASTX package fastx_spats_toolkit_0.0.1, which
is available from http://spats.sourceforge.net .

Please install these and make sure they are accessible through your PATH
environment variable before trying to run the mapping pipeline.


Spats Usage
===========
UPDATE

Usage:
     spats [options] <rna.fasta> <treated_handle> <untreated_handle> <barcode_reads> <adduct_reads>

The treated_handle and untreated_handle are IUPAC strings indicating the barcoding
scheme for the 1M7-treated and untreated pools.

Given a paired end run with unbarcoded target sequences (in DNA alphabet) in the file 
target_bcs.fa, barcode reads in HCT20611_50bp_s_7_1_sequence, and 
adduct reads in HCT20611_50bp_s_7_2_sequence, you can run the mapping pipeline like this:

spats -p 4 \
 --adapter-t AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC \
 --adapter-b AGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG \
 -o HCT20611_50bp.final \
 target_bcs.fa \
