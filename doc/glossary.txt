some terms defined:

- target: base RNA sequence
  - 5' end === left end
  - 3' end === right end
    - R1 is (in non-cotrans) aligned with the right/3' end

- fragment: thing (cDNA) in the machine (a.k.a "read"), generated by reverse transcription (RT) of the RNA

- segment: what code calls sequence, one of the two ends of the fragment

- pair: pair of segments are the ends of the fragment

- R1/R2: names of the right and left segments
  - R1 is right end (and reverse-complemented) - "reverse read"
  - R2 is left end - "forward read"

- mapped read:   R1/R2 both map successfully to target

- handle: first four bp of R1 -> indicates which experimental condition
  - treated = positive = RRRY
  - untreated = negative = YYYR (= control)
  - also known as "mask" or "4mers"

- addunct: something attached to the RNA at "reactive" sites due to chemical probes (treatment) revealing structure
    - we are trying to characterize where these occur (indirectly) by looking at mutations and stops (which they cause) in cDNA reads of the RNA
    - we use the untreated (no probe) sample for background rates / normalization

- adapter: sequence added to the right end of target to sequence short fragments
  - "adapter trimming": handling this in the code
  - adapter_b is for R1, adapter_t is for R2

- dumbbell:  sequence added to the 5' end of fragment, i.e. both reads (similar to a "forward primer"?).  if present, R2 starts with this prior to the target.

- prefix:  part of segment (typically R2 since on left side) that precedes the part where the segment matches the target
    - prefixes can be counted or "collapsed" (pretend it's not there so that we can still match the target)

- cotrans: different analysis that doesn't require R1 on the very right edge
  - linker: fixed sequence, appended to right of end, part of R1

- end: the right end of a fragment (variable in cotrans, fixed to the right end of the target otherwise)

- site: when an r1/r2 pair is matched to the target, the left end of r2 is the site/stop (counted as "f")
    - note that pair.site is reported from a 0-based array but it is interpretted as being 1-based, so...
    - site/stop is alternatively (and equivalently):
        - the 0-based index of the last matching nucleotide base
        - the 1-based index where the addunct was, one to the left of the last matching nucleotide base
- meanwhile, mutations (and indels) are reported using 1-based indexes to the spot that changed

- stats:
  - counts: counters that track the number of r1/r2 pairs that matched an end/site
  - reactivity: relative likelihood of a stop or mutation at a spot
    - high reactivity at N --> likely stop or mutation at N
  - specific stats:
    - betas: treated/untreated comparative intermediate stat (~prob of site at N) (at site N)
    - thetas: treated/untreated comparative intermediate stat (~relative reactivity) (at site N)
    - rhos: reactivity at site N (desired stat)
    - mus: like rho, but counting mutations
    - c: estimate of the average modification rate (one per experiment)
  - allow_negative_values: config option that specifies whether beta/theta/mu can be negative or not
    - this also affects result for c-value


Generally, experiments look like:
   R1':    AAAAAAAAAAAAAA.DDDDDDDD.TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.LLLLLLL.MMMM...................
   R2:     ...............DDDDDDDD.TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT.LLLLLLL.MMMM.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Where:
   A+ = adapters (adapter_b on left and adapter_t on right)
   D+ = optional dumbbell (forward/R2 reads will always start here if present)
   T+ = region to be matched/aligned with a reference target;
        if no linker/rt_primer, then always goes all the way to the right end
        of the reference target, but does not necessarily start at the beginning.
   L+ = optional rt_primer or linker in the case of cotrans or multiple_rt_starts experiments
        (R2 read may end before or during this)
   M+ = mask/handle designating treatment (reverse/R1 reads will always start here)
