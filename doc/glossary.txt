some terms defined:

- target: base sequence
  - 5' end === left end
  - 3' end === right end
    - R1 is (in non-cotrans) on the right/3' end

- fragment: thing in the machine (a.k.a "read")

- segment: what code calls sequence, one of the two ends of the fragment

- pair: pair of segments are the ends of the fragment

- R1/R2: names of the right and left segments
  - R1 is right end (and reverse-complemented)
  - R2 is left end

- handle: first four bp of R1 -> indicates which experimental condition
  - treated = positive = RRRY
  - untreated = negative = YYYR (= control)
  - also known as "mask"

- adapter: sequence added to the right end of target to sequence short fragments
  - "adapter trimming": handling this in the code
  - adapter_b is for R1, adapter_t is for R2

- prefix:  part of segment (typically R2 since on left side) that precedes the part where the segment matches the target
    - prefixes can be counted or "collapsed" (pretend it's not there so that we can still match the target)

- cotrans: different analysis that doesn't require R1 on the very right edge
  - linker: fixed sequence, appended to right of end, part of R1

- end: the right end of a fragment (variable in cotrans, fixed to the right end of the target otherwise)

- site: when an r1/r2 pair is matched to the target, the left end of r2 is the site/stop (counted as "f")

- stats:
  - counts: counters that track the number of r1/r2 pairs that matched an end/site
  - reactivity: relative likelihood of a stop at a spot
    - high reactivity at N --> likely stop at N
  - specific stats:
    - betas: treated/untreated comparative intermediate stat (~prob of modification at N) (at site N)
    - thetas: treated/untreated comparative intermediate stat (~relative reactivity) (at site N)
    - rhos: reactivity at site N (desired stat)
    - mus: like rho, but counting mutations
    - c: estimate of the average modification rate (one per experiment)
  - allow_negative_values: config option that specifies whether beta/theta/mu can be negative or not
    - this also affects result for c-value
