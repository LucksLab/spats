The Spats package implements a read mapping and reactivity analysis pipeline for calculating
SHAPE-Seq reactivities from an input set of next-generation reads. The reactivity calculation
implemented is described in:

  * `make -s`
  * add `bin` directory to your `PATH`


Spats Usage
===========
For detailed usage and examples, please see http://luckslab.github.io/spats/manual.html

The spats pipeline is run in two stages: adapter trimming and spats analysis. Adapter trimming is implemented in the adapter_trimmer code, while spats analysis is implemented in the spats toolkit. A typical workflow is as follows:

adapter_trimmer --A-b-sequence=<second_adapter_sequence> --A-t-sequence=<first_adapter_sequence> --read-len=35 R1.fastq R2.fastq RNA_targets.fa

spats --num-mismatches 0 -o Output RNA_targets.fa RRRY YYYR combined_R1.fastq combined_R2.fastq

where <second_adapter_sequence> is the sequence of the second adapter (present at the 3' end of cDNAs), <first_adapter_sequence> is the sequence of the first adapter (present at the 5' end of cDNAs), R1.fastq and R2.fastq are the fastq sequencing files from the sequencing run, and RNA_targets.fa is the FASTA formatted file containing the RNA sequences under study. Spats outputs text files (in Output) containing (+) and (-) fragment counts, beta's and thetaâ€™s, for each position in each RNA in the targets file.

Usage:
     adapter_trimmer [options]* <R1_seq.fastq> <R2_seq.fastq> <targets.fa>

     spats [options]* <targets.fa> <treated_handle> <untreated_handle> <R1_seq.fastq> <R2_seq.fastq>

     reactivities_split [options] <reactivities_file.out>

<targets.fa> is a fasta file containing the RNA sequences under study.
<R1_seq.fastq> is a fastq file containing "_1" reads from a paired-end Illumina run.
<R2_seq.fastq> is a fastq file containing "_2" reads from a paired-end Illumina run.
<treated_handle> and <untreated_handle> are IUPAC strings indicating the barcoding
scheme for the 1M7-treated and untreated pools.
<reactivities_file.out> is the output reactivities file from spats.

Given a paired end run (2x35bp) with target sequences (in DNA alphabet) in the file 
target_bcs.fa, "_1" reads in HCT20611_50bp_s_7_1_sequence.fq, and 
"_2" reads in HCT20611_50bp_s_7_2_sequence.fq, you can run the mapping pipeline like this:

adapter_trimmer --A-b-sequence=AGATCGGAAGAGCGGTTCAGCAGGAATGCCGAGACCGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG --A-t-sequence=AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC --read-len=35 HCT20611_50bp_s_7_1_sequence.fq HCT20611_50bp_s_7_2_sequence.fq target_bcs.fa

spats --num-mismatches 0 -o HCT20611_50bp.final RRRY YYYR combined_R1.fastq combined_R2.fastq

cd HCT20611_50bp.final
reactivities_split reactivities.out
